## Prompt

Delegated task from the parent agent:
New user task: add deep analysis channel input including speech; media processing STT,TTS,voicecloning; implement libraries+CLI with auto backend choice and overrides. You own research/documentation ONLY: deeply inspect relevant local source (../ai-media/voicestudio,streambert,personalive and channel/speech paths in existing agentrepos as useful), plus current primary official sources for Whisper.cpp/faster-whisper/Piper/Chatterbox or F5 and OpenAI/ElevenLabs audio contracts. Browse current primary docs required, no credentialed calls. Produce spec/channel-input.md and spec/media-processing.md, per-project reports for newly analyzed sources, update related spec/channels.md, generation.md, import-generation.md links. Scope documents clearly source facts vs implemented behavior (root will reconcile implementation contract). Cover VAD/endpointing/streaming/barg-in, diarization/timestamps, privacy/auth/dedup channel envelope, codecpipeline, quality/cost/latency selection/evals, cloning resource/provenance/consent support (no blanket prohibition). Recommend implementable backends with API contract evidence. Preserve existing user changes/research records. Do not edit lib/app/package or shared modules docs. Read applicable required architecture/skills. Send early shortlist and exact API recommendations to root. All paths in docs relative, source citations upstream pinnedGitHub. No shell approvals concurrently with root; normal reads/writesfine. Own focuseddocs nofullrootgates. Archive your final with metadataunknown ifneeded coordinated.

Additional delegated implementation scope:
After docs validation, please own architecture registration updates: lib/lint/modules.ts add portable media/channels no dependencies; spec/architecture/modules.md table and boundaries doc; package.json exports media/media-bun channels/channels-bun; test/cli.test.ts expected catalog order media,channels after integrations before lint. Extend lib/lint/modularity.ts host boundaries for app/media and app/channels and focused lint fixtures after reading relevant lint skills. No app/cli edits (root integrating). You may run read-only Git HEAD/clean checks needed for citations normal sandbox first; no escalations until coordinated. Root will write spec/media-runtime.md CLI/config docs. Keep implementation/planned distinction.

Final refinement:
After pending approval resolved, extend exact shared helper allowlist for app/channels -> app/imports/lifecycle.ts only, plus fixture/docs. Fingerprint reads must use scopedHostPromise to join file cleanup on cancellation; no full imports pipeline dependency.

## Response

Added channel-input and media-processing analyses, eight focused project reviews, and related links. Verified all ten cited local files against pinned GitHub blobs and checked 420 relative file links.

Registered media/channels modules and package exports, documented host boundaries, and added 12 lint fixture pairs. The parent owns integrated verification.

No live microphone, model inference, or paid API calls were made.

## Processing Log

I’ll review the speech and media sources, then document channel ingestion, streaming voice behavior, and backend selection with clear evidence for each recommendation.

The source review separates speech processing from media playback and avatar rendering. I also found material API changes: OpenAI’s current live transcription model needs client-controlled turn commits, and its older speech endpoint has a published retirement date. Those constraints will be explicit in backend selection.

The useful local patterns are explicit hardware fallback, separate speech detection and transcription, and cancellation that acknowledges playback. Voice cloning also needs its own resource lifecycle: reference recordings, provider verification state, revocation, and separate handling of local voice conditioning.

The two main analyses are drafted, with eight focused project reviews. The recommendations now distinguish backend discovery from proven readiness, file transcription from live conversation, and voice registration from training. I’m checking source anchors and relative links before handing them over.

I’m applying the repository’s Oxlint rule guidance to register the new modules and enforce their host boundaries. This keeps media processing and channel ingestion out of client bundles and portable domain code.

All ten newly cited local source files match their pinned GitHub blobs, and the research documents’ relative file links resolve. The remaining verification is the integrated module and CLI checks; live audio quality and provider access are explicitly outside the completed source review.
