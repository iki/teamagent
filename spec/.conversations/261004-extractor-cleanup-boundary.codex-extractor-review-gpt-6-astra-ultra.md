## Prompt

Please handle the lint boundary fix I just sent: imports adapter may not import runtime implementation, so move scopedHostPromise to app/imports/lifecycle.ts; retain only withHostInterruption in runtime/interruption.ts. Update imports/tests and future benchmark codeHashes. Do not weaken architecture rule. Root awaits fix to rerun gate.

## Response

Moved the scoped cleanup helper into app/imports/lifecycle.ts and updated adapters, tests and benchmark provenance hashes. Host signal handling remains in runtime/interruption.ts. Architecture rules are unchanged; root will rerun the assembled gate.
